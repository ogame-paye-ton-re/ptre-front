# PTRE - Paye Ton RE

PTRE is an easy-to-use [tolerated tool](https://forum.origin.ogame.gameforge.com/forum/thread/37-ptre-spy-report-sharing-tool-over-discord-oglight-infinity/) to save and share spy reports for OGame browser game. You can save spy reports from:

- [OGLight script](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nullNaN/OGLight), by installing the add-on into your browser

- Directly through the [PTRE website](https://ptre.chez.gg/)

Your spy reports will be shared only with your team mates. PTRE can also create an ingame activity profiles, manage and sort spy reports, and more...

## Tolerated tool

**PTRE is a Gameforge tolerated tool**. You may check official post here: [OGame Origin post](https://forum.origin.ogame.gameforge.com/forum/thread/37-ptre-spy-report-sharing-tool-over-discord-oglight-infinity-agr/).

## One big step to Open Source!

Since December 2024, **PTRE frontend is being rebuilt as an Open Source projet**, via this repository. [iiNSick](https://github.com/Jbaukens) is leading the front redesign, while [GeGe](https://github.com/GeGeGM) is reworking backend. For now, endpoints used by ingame tools wont change (might be reworked later on).
