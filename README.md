PTRE is an easy-to-use [tolerated tool](https://forum.origin.ogame.gameforge.com/forum/thread/37-ptre-spy-report-sharing-tool-over-discord-oglight-infinity/) to save and share spy reports for the OGame browser game.

You can save spy reports from:
- Discord, by installing the [PTRE bot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=512294332058042388&scope=bot)
- [OGLight script](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/nullNaN/OGLight), by installing the add-on into your browser

- Directly through the [PTRE website](https://ptre.chez.gg/)

Your spy reports will only be shared with your teammates. PTRE can also:
- Create in-game activity profiles

- Frontend redesign led by [iiNSick](https://github.com/Jbaukens)

For now, endpoints used by in-game tools will remain unchanged, with possible updates in the future.
